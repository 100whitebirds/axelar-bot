üí† Axelar is a cross-chain platform that meets the needs of platform developers and application creators. The Axelar network consists of a decentralized network that connects blockchain ecosystems that speak different languages and a set of protocols with application programming interfaces.

‚úÖ  Axelar is a gem among programming. Once everyone was tormented to create their own interpreter for each language so that the machine could understand the code. But then appears an assembler, a machine code that converts the input code into computer-readable code. Axelar will develop a similar decentralized application, only in the field of cryptocurrency. Imagine how quickly it will be possible to turn your idea into reality!

üì±  Axelar Network will create an application for users, using which it will be possible to move their coins without any problems, because they will be located in the Axelar network.

Axelar‚Äôs decentralized network, protocols, and APIs provide the following benefits to the ecosystem:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Axelar increases asset mobility, liquidity, and enables composability of smart contracts across autonomous blockchains.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Blockchain platform builders can seamlessly plug-in their blockchains to all other blockchain ecosystems, through a single point of integration.

3Ô∏è‚É£ A universal connector allows easy movement of assets in/out of the integrated networks. As Axelar adds more blockchains into its protocol, all connected networks benefit.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Developers can host their dapps on the best blockchain for their use-case, while maintaining access to assets and applications on any other chain.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Users can use any asset, natively through their wallets, to provide liquidity on applications across the blockchain ecosystem.
